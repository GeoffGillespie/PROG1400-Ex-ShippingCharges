Calculate shipping charges for a shopper
Display a welcome message
Ask the user to enter the amount for their total purchase
If their total is under $50 add $10, otherwise shipping is free
Tell the user their final total including shipping costs
For now, donâ€™t worry about proper currency formatting or rounding (unless you want to!).
